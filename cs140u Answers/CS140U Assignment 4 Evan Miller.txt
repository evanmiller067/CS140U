If the files do not exist, please create dummy ones.

1. Create this sample file, you can call it student grades
John    Doe     3.54    ECE
James   Davis    3.71    ECE
Al      Davis    2.63    CS
Ahmad   Rashid  3.74    MBA
Sam     Chu      3.68    ECE
Arun    Roy      3.06    SS
Rick    Marsh   2.34    CS
James   Adam    2.77    CS
Art     Pohm    4.00    ECE
John    Clark    2.68    ECE
Nabeel  Ali     3.56    EE
Tom     Nelson  3.81    ECE
Pat     King    2.77    SS
Jake    Zulu    3.00    CS
John    Lee     2.64    EE
Sunil   Raj     3.36    ECE
Charles Right   3.31    EECS
Diane   Rover   3.87    ECE
Aziz    Inan    3.75    EECS
Lu      John    3.06    CS
Lee     Chow    3.74    EE
Adam    Giles   2.54    SS
Andy    John    3.98    EECS

The file above contains student records. Use a command line to display the records for the top five students in descending (sorted) order, i.e., with the highest GPA student’s record displayed first. Show your session.


> sort -grk 3 studentGrades.txt|head -n 5 
Art     Pohm    4.00    ECE
Andy    John    3.98    EECS
Diane   Rover   3.87    ECE
Tom     Nelson  3.81    ECE
Aziz    Inan    3.75    EECS


2. Create sample files lab1, lab2, lab3 and lab4. They can be created using vi, or doing something like who > lab1, etc. Once you have created the file, display its content with the cat command. Show your session.


> touch lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4
        > echo "sample lab 1 text" >> lab1
        > cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4
                lab1 content
                lab2 content
                lab3 content
                lab4 content

Combine the lab files: lab1, lab2, lab3, and lab4 appending them >>  to a file called all.labs  . Any errors (pretend one of those lab files do not exist) should be redirected to an error.log file. Since you will have all the files, once you redirect the error 2>, assume that you do not have one of the files that consequently would generate an error, in this case the error.log file will be empty, but to build the command include the 2> as if one of the files did not exist. This whole command will be in one line.  Show your session.


> cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4 > all.labs 2> error.log

> cat all.labs
> cat error.log  
> rm lab4
> cat lab1 lab2 lab3 lab4 > all.labs 2> error.log  
> cat error.log        //does not exist 
cat: lab4: No such file or directory

3. How many soft links are there in the /usr directory. Show the command and its output.


> ls -l /usr | awk 'NR != 1 {sum += $2} END {print sum}'

Create a file named students containing the following data in your current directory. Each line in this file represents a student's first name, last name, and 3 exam scores. Each line should be regarded as a record containing 5 fields separated by one or more tab characters. You must use the awk command to answer the questions below

Tom Jones 100 90 80
Nancy Jones 70 80 90 
Terry Sims 55 65 75 
John Terry 75 76 77 
Ruth Maier 100 100 100 
Mike Wolfe 90 95 98 
Dennis Cole 70 80 89 
Ron Maier 90 85 89 
Susan Miller 65 80 90 
Mad Bill 75 65 77

4. Use AWK. What command line would display the contents of students file such that first names and last names are swapped?

> awk '{print $2, $1, $3, $4, $5}' students

5. Use AWK. What command line would display the first and last names of those who got 100 on their first exam (there are examples in the book)?

> awk '$3 == 100 {print $1, $2}' students

6. Use AWK. What command line would display the contents of the students file with line numbers in front of each line?


> awk '{printf "%3s %s\n", NR, $0}' students
